							You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
						   	You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
						   	So when you're waiting for the next attack
						   	You'd better stand, there's no turning back
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							The bugle sounds and the charge begins
							But on this battlefield no one wins
						  	The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
					      	As I plunge on into certain death
					  	</p>
					  	<br>
					  	<p>
							Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
							Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
					  	</p>
					  	<br>
						<p>
							The horse he sweats, with fear, we break to run
							The mighty roar of the russian guns
							And as we race towards the human wall
							The screams of pain as my comrades fall
					  	</p>
					  	<br>
					  	<p>
							We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
							And the russians fire another round
							We get so near yet so far away
							We won't live to fight another day
					  	</p>
					  	<br>
					  	<p>
							Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
							Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
					  	</p>
						<p>
							We get so close, near enough to fight
							When a russian gets me in his sights
							He pulls the trigger, and I feel the blow
							A burst of rounds take my horse below
					  	</p>
					  	<br>
					  	<p>
					  		And as I lay there gazing at the sky
							My body's numb and my throat is dry
							And as I lay forgotten and alone
							Without a tear I draw my parting groan
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
							Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
					  	</p>
