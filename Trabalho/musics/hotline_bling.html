								Ever since I left the city you<br>
								Got a reputation for yourself now<br>
								Everybody knows and I feel left out<br>
								Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out<br>
								Cause ever since I left the city, you<br>
								Started wearing less and goin' out more<br>
								Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor<br>
								Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<br>

								Ever since I left the city, you, you, you<br>
								You and me, we just don't get along<br>
								You make me feel like I did you wrong<br>
								Going places where you don't belong<br>
								Ever since I left the city, you<br>
								You got exactly what you asked for<br>
								Running out of pages in your passport<br>
								Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<br>

								These days, all I do is<br>
								Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else<br>
								Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else<br>
								Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else<br>
								You don't need no one else<br>
								You don't need nobody else, no<br>
								Why you never alone?<br>
								Why you always touching road?<br>
								Used to always stay at home, be a good girl<br>
								You was in the zone, yeah<br>
								You should just be yourself<br>
								Right now, you're someone else<br>
