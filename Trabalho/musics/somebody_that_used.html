								Now and then I think of when we were together<br>
								Like when you said you felt so happy you could die<br>
								Told myself that you were right for me<br>
								But felt so lonely in your company<br>
								But that was love and it's an ache I still remember<br>
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness<br>
								Like resignation to the end, always the end<br>
								So when we found that we could not make sense<br>
								Well, you said that we would still be friends<br>
								But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over<br>
						  	</p>
						  	<br>
						  	<p>
								But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
								Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
								And I don't even need your love<br>
								But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br>
						  	</p>
						  	<br>
							<p>
								No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
								Have your friends collect your records and then<br>
								change your number<br>
								I guess that I don't need that though<br>
								Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
								Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
								Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
						  	</p>
						  	<br>
						  	<p>
								Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over<br>
								But had me believing it was always something that I'd done<br>
								But I don't wanna live that way, reading into every word you say<br>
								You said that you could let it go<br>
								And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know<br>
						  	</p>
						  	<br>
						  	<p>
								But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
								Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
								And I don't even need your love<br>
								But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br>
								No, you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
								Have your friends collect your records and then change your number<br>
								I guess that I don't need that though<br>
								Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
						  	</p>
						  	<br>
							<p>
								Somebody, I used to know<br>
								Somebody, now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
								Somebody, I used to know<br>
								Somebody, now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
						  	</p>
						  	<br>
						  	<p>
						  		I used to know<br>
								That I used to know<br>
								I used to know<br>
								Somebody<br>
